## About me

<img src="/assets/img/TaeUngLee.jpg" width="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 10px;" alt="Profile Picture">


I'm an undergraduate student in **Mechanical Engineering at Korea University**, passionate about developing **AI-driven robotic systems** that can seamlessly integrate into real-world applications. My goal is to advance the field of autonomous robotics through innovative hardware design and intelligent control systems, making robotic technology more accessible and reliable for everyday use.

My research interests bridge the gap between traditional mechanical engineering and cutting-edge AI technology through several key approaches:
- **(1) Enhancing robotic manipulation capabilities using machine learning algorithms for data analysis and sensor development**
- **(2) Developing sophisticated gripper designs and hardware systems for improved robot-environment interaction**
- **(3) Advancing autonomous vehicle technologies through computer vision and intelligent control systems**

## Academic Journey & Research Experience

Having completed my military service(2021.07~2023.01) <br>
I am now in my final academic year at Korea University, with **expected graduation in August 2026**. Throughout my undergraduate journey, I have gained valuable hands-on research experience as an undergraduate intern researcher at prestigious institutions including **Seoul National University, Yonsei University, Korea University, and KIST (Korea Institute of Science and Technology)**.

These diverse research experiences have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of both theoretical foundations and practical applications in robotics and AI.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning-based Data Analysis and Sensor Development**
- **Robot Control Systems and Hardware Design**
- **Gripper Design and Manipulation Technologies**
- **AI-powered Autonomous Vehicles and Computer Vision**
- **Integration of Mechanical Systems with Intelligent Algorithms**

## Personal Philosophy

What sets me apart is my **unwavering commitment to excellence** and my **systematic approach to tackling challenging problems**. I believe that even the most complex engineering challenges can be overcome through dedicated effort, detailed planning, and step-by-step execution.

I am currently planning to pursue **graduate studies (Master's or integrated Master's-PhD program)** to further deepen my expertise in AI-integrated robotics.
